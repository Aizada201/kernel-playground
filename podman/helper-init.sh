# Kernel setup
#
# 1) Copy the pre-shipped linux config file into the `kernel/linux` directory
#    containing the kernel source code;
# 2) Build the kernel;
# 3) Build the out-of-tree (OOT) kernel module, and then copy the resulting
#    module into the VM subproject's shared folder. Specifically, place the
#    module inside a directory shared with the VM instance at `/mnt/shared`.
#    This allows the module to be loaded directly from the running guest OS by
#    accessing this shared folder;
# 4) For installation, create a symbolic link to the compiled `bzImage` (built
#    for the current architecture, only x86_64 has been tested so far) within
#    the VM subproject. This ensures the VM will boot using this specific
#    kernel version. Note that the kernel configuration provided results in a
#    statically built kernel, so no external modules are required at runtime.
